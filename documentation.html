                <h3>Port Declaration</h3>
                <p>
                    As any normal programming language works, where code must be written within classes or methods.
                    Hardware descriptive languages work the same way around in which code is written within <b>Modules</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functionality is described within the module. Each module is declared with two keywords, 
                    <b>module and endmodule</b>. Now in our Visual Verilog main page; you will find a category on the left
                    panel "Port declaration", this category contains blocks to represent initializing a new module, declare
                    input/ output variables and the <b>end</b> module block which is essential and very important to plug in
                    at the end of your module to achieve correct syntax modules.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Let's have an example to display any text to the user:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We will go inside the first and main category of our application. Drag "create new module block" into workspace
                    Now to start executing stuff at t=0, or in other words as soon as the program is compiled; the "intial" keyword
                    must be used. Thus, going into the <b>Behavioral</b> category that I'll explain in no time. Append the new module
                    block with the "Execute at t=0" block from Behavioral category and from the <b>simulation2</b> category, users can
                    find a print block where he/she could write any text to be displayed. Finally don't forget the <b>End</b> block inside
                    Module declaration category to be attached at the end.
